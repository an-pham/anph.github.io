Welcome to my blog, a little corner where I share my knowledge, life experiences, and the incredible journey I’m fortunate enough to be on. This is my way of connecting with the world, and I hope our connection is as enjoyable for you as it is for me to share.

I’m a curious girl from Vietnam, who spent most of my childhood dreaming of traveling the world. One day, that dream became my reality. Now, living far from home, I’m on a quest to embrace every opportunity life has to offer while honoring my roots.

By day, I’m a 9-to-5 ninja. By night, I enjoy maintaining this little space, playing badminton, and exploring my love for crafting. Who knows where this hobby will take me? Maybe one day, I’ll be lucky enough to see the smiles of people using something I made. For now, handmade gifts bring joy to my friends, and that’s all I need to make my day.

And here’s my favorite quote—what’s yours?

>“Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.”

<cite>- Bernard M. Baruch</cite>
