Welcome to my blog, a simple place in which I would like to share about my knowledge, life experiences, and the amazing journey that I am lucky enough to be a part of. This is my way to connect with the world. I hope you will enjoy our connection as much as I enjoy sharing with you.

I am a curious girl grew up in Vietnam and has spent most of my childhood dreaming of traveling the world. One day, this fantasy is just no longer a dream. Now living miles away from home, I am in a quest to enjoy every opportunity life has to offer and embracing my inheritance.

Besides being a 9-to-5 ninja, I enjoy maintaining this little space and play some badminton in my free time. Crafting is also another hobby of mine, I'm quite looking forward to see how far this hobby can go. Who knows, maybe some day we can see the smiles of people using stuff I made :) But for now, those little handmade gifts make my friends happy, and that made my day!

And here, my favorite quote, what's yours?

>“Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.”
